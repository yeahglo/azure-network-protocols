<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this analysis, we'll observe and experiment with different network protocols, a firewall, and traffic between two virtual machines running in Azure. We'll use a powerful protocol analyzer called Wireshark to inspect raw traffic running between the two virtual machines.

<br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)
- Network Protocols: ICMP, DHCP, DNS, RDP
- Network Security Groups in Azure
- Command Line Tools
- Remote Desktop

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10, version 22H2
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

**VM and Wireshark Setup**

<p>To begin, we'll make sure to set up our two virtual machines (VMs) properly. "VM1" will run Windows 10, and "VM2" will run an Ubuntu Server. In Azure, we'll make sure to use the same VNET (virtual network). To inspect traffic, we'll download and install Wireshark from https://www.wireshark.org/download.html and set it to capture ethernet traffic.</p>
